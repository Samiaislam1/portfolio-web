            <p>Iâ€™m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless
                information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

            <p>You'll want anyone viewing your resume to be easily taken in by your hard skills and experience. But it's
                also important to make sure your resume is focused on achievements, not just day-to-day tasks.</p>

                <p>Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to
                    others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing
                    and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
